# Neural Networks
- Neural networks are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.
- They are also known as Artificial Neural Networks(ANN).

# What is Layer ?
- A layer consists of number of neurons connected together with some weight and bias.

# What is Neuron ?
- A neuron is composed of two parts -
    - Sum of weights and bias.
    - Activation function which decides whether to activate or deactivate neuron.
